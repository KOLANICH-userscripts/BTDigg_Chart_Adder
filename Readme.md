BTDigg

Popularity is taken from [BTDigg](https://btdigg.org/) service through its API.
You need to accept its [ToS](https://btdigg.org/about/termsofservice.html) and [Privacy Policy](https://btdigg.org/about/privacypolicy.html) because this script can send some data there. Sending
this data can ruin your privacy because BTDigg would be able to know what BT magnet links do you hover with your mouse pointer.


Third-party
--
The script uses some third-party images and libraries :

* preloader was generated with [preloaders.net](http://preloaders.net/) (APNG version was used because it looks better, but Chrome won't show it animated);
* and tooltip css (with some modifications by me) generated with [cssarrowplease.com](http://cssarrowplease.com/);
* [Flotr](https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/Flotr2), a chart protting library.

Look the [source code](https://github.com/KOLANICH/BTDigg_Chart_Adder/blob/master/btdigg.user.js) for details. The script's license is [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
